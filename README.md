# Trailblazer - Android Hiking Tracker
## An Android app that tracks your phone without using GPS.
-----
### This app uses you phone's built-in pedometer and gyroscope to map where you traveled. *All data is stored locally on your device.*

Thousands of people go missing in the woods every year. Trailblazer will help guide you back to safety in such a scenario.
Once started, it will track your phone's location using no external factors (such as GPS). This means that Trailblazer has you covered, wherever you go.

The map created by the app can help you retrace your steps back to safety.
